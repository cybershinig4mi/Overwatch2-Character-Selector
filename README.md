# Overwatch2-Character-Selector
Instant Overwatch 2 python character selector with GUI. Read Readme for instructions for use.


1. Install all libraries needed ( they are at the top of the code )
2. Run the code
3. press y to start the GUI
4. select your desired character ( there are only 5 for now as they are the only ones i use, create a suggestion in the 'issues' category and i will either add the character you want or make it so you can choose the characters you want by recording co-ordinates)
5. This is the version i made without the pixel checker ( which is paid) so when you load into a game you must press 'q' The program will wait 1 second as there is a delay before you can select the characters in the game and then it will select the character and press continue
6. The program must be re-run once you finish that game and want to go into another one
